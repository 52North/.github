# :rocket: Welcome to the 52°North Code Space 

52°North is devoted to spatial information research. As a non-profit company, we support open science through open data and open source software. Our major interest is developing spatial research data infrastructures to foster the derivation of information from data.

Turning data into information is the key to making informed decisions. Through Spatial Information Research, 52°North develops methods, technologies and solutions to support the information generation, and hence the decision process.

We are spatial data enthusiasts! :earth_africa: 🫶🏽
